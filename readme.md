# Soccer League Builder
This python app divides a group of players in to 3 well balanced teams. It reads in players from a CSV file then splits the players up based on their experience level. Each team gets an equal number of experienced players. Once the teams are sorted, a ```teams.txt``` file is created where all players are written to the file and grouped with their respective teams. Included is the players name, if they have experience, and the parent/gardian names.
